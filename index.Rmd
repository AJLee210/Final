# About
 
This is a _portfolio_ book of the previous assignments using **Bookdown** package. 
Each **bookdown** chapter is an '.Rmd file' of the weekly assignment that I have done 
in ESS580A7 class so far. 


## How to read this book

Considering the criteria below will help you understand this book more easily.    

  1. Each chapter has its own topic and data. In other words, it is made up of a book, but it is complete in each chapter rather than sequentially.    

  2. The content of this book is to learn various techniques such as interactive graphs, map views, and regression analysis using data, and you can discover the characteristics of each chapter.    

  3. For the more convenient readability of the reader, some contents are not displayed.


```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
