The Poudre River is the main source of water for Fort Collins, flowing from the peaks of the Rocky Mountains into the western vast plains. The river travels through a variety of terrain, exhibiting ever-changing quantities that change with the seasons. **By observing the discharge of the Poudre River, I want to understand the characteristics of the river.**

## Data Acquisition and Plotting tests

### Data Download

I collect water discharge data upstream and downstream of Poudre by using NWIS dataset. 

```{r downloader}

Up <- readNWISdv(siteNumbers = '06752260',
                parameterCd = '00060',
                startDate = '2017-01-01',
                endDate = '2020-01-01') %>%
  rename(Q_up = 'X_00060_00003')


Down <- readNWISdv(siteNumbers = '06752280',
                parameterCd = '00060',
                startDate = '2017-01-01',
                endDate = '2020-01-01') %>%
  rename(Q_down = 'X_00060_00003') 

River <- merge (Up, Down, by='Date')

```


### Interactive Data Plotter 

```{r, fig.cap='Discharge of the Poudre', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}

Up_xts <- xts(River$Q_up, order.by = River$Date)
Down_xts <- xts(River$Q_down, order.by = River$Date)
Discharge <- cbind(Up_xts, Down_xts)
dygraph(Discharge, main = "Discharge of Poudre") %>%
  dySeries("Up_xts", label = "Upstream(cfs)") %>%
  dySeries("Down_xts", label = "Downstream(cfs)") %>%
  dyLegend(show = "always", hideOnMouseOut = FALSE)



```


## Conclusions

**The Poudre River has several characteristics as below:**

- The Poudre river tends to decrease its discharge over time. This is probably seemed due to less snow, a major water resource of the Poudre.
  **Is it the impact of climate change?**

- *The Flow tends to decrease as going downstream. This is believed to be due to either a runoff of water for cultivating nearby agricultural land or a sharply reduced flow rate as it approaches the plains.*

- Do you know that the main fish that inhabits in the Poudre is Brown trout that is non-native fish?

- Finally, I think one of the most fun things to do in Poudre is rafting along the rough rivers in summer. If you do not yet, try it this summer. **Have some cool fun in Poudre**
